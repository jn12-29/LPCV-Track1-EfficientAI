# [Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Recipe: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding and generation tasks](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen2_5_7b_instruct_recipe)

The Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct is a state-of-the-art multilingual language model with 7 billion parameters, excelling in language understanding, generation, coding, and mathematics.

This is based on the implementation of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Recipe found [here](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen2_5_7b_instruct_recipe).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Deploying Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on-device

Please follow the [LLM on-device deployment](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial.


## Setup
### 1. Install the package
Install the package via pip:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install "qai-hub-models[qwen2-5-7b-instruct-recipe]"
```
For qwen2_5_7b_instruct_recipe, some additional functionality can be faster or is available
only with a GPU on the host machine.

- 🟢 Exporting the model for on-device deployment (GPU not required)
- 🟡 Running the demo (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🟡 Running evaluation (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🔴 Quantizing the model (GPU required)

If you are quantizing your own variant of qwen2_5_7b_instruct_recipe, a dedicated CUDA enabled
GPU (40 GB VRAM for 3B models to 80 GB VRAM for 8B models) is recommended. A GPU
can also increase the speed of evaluation and demo of your quantized model
significantly but it not strictly required.

Install the GPU package via pip:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install "qai-hub-models[qwen2-5-7b-instruct-recipe]" onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2 https://github.com/quic/aimet/releases/download/2.26.0/aimet_onnx-2.26.0+cu121-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

### 2. Configure Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench
Sign-in to [Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/) with your
Qualcomm® ID. Once signed in navigate to `Account -> Settings -> API Token`.

With this API token, you can configure your client to run models on the cloud
hosted devices.
```bash
qai-hub configure --api_token API_TOKEN
```
Navigate to [docs](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/docs/) for more information.

## Run CLI Demo
Run the following simple CLI demo to verify the model is working end to end:

```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.qwen2_5_7b_instruct_recipe.demo
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment
To run the model on Qualcomm® devices, you must export the model for use with an edge runtime such as
TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or Qualcomm AI Engine Direct. Use the following command to export the model:
```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.qwen2_5_7b_instruct_recipe.export
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
